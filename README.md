`py17track` is a simple Python library to track packages in
[17track.net](http://www.17track.net/) accounts.

Since this is uses an unofficial API, there's no guarantee that 17track.net
will provide every field for every package, all the time. Additionally, this
API may stop working at any moment.

# Python Versions

`py17track` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7

However, running the test suite currently requires Python 3.6 or higher; tests
run on Python 3.5 will fail.

# Installation

```python
pip install py17track
```

# Usage

`py17track` starts within an
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from py17track import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Create a client then get to it:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from py17track import Client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      client = Client(websession)

      # Login to 17track.net:
      await client.profile.login('<EMAIL>', '<PASSWORD>')

      # Get the account ID:
      client.profile.account_id
      # >>> 1234567890987654321

      # Get a summary of the user's packages:
      summary = await client.profile.summary()
      # >>> {'In Transit': 3, 'Expired': 3, ... }

      # Get all packages associated with a user's account:
      packages = await client.profile.packages()
      # >>> [py17track.package.Package(..), ...]


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Each `Package` object has the following info:

* `destination_country`: the country the package was shipped to
* `friendly_name`: the human-friendly name of the package
* `info`: a text description of the latest status
* `location`: the current location (if known)
* `origin_country`: the country the package was shipped from
* `package_type`: the type of package (if known)
* `status`: the overall package status ("In Transit", "Delivered", etc.)
* `tracking_info_language`: the language of the tracking info
* `tracking_number`: the all-important tracking number
